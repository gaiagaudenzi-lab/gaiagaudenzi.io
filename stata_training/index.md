title: Stata training

This "Stata guide" is intended to be a handy resource for you, and you can use it the way you want. It is divided in topic but it is not consequential, meaning you can jump from one chapter to another without any problems. 

If you already have a knowledge of what Stata is, you can definitely skip the Stata basic part. I will try to cover from the very basic to the very advanced (as far as I know), but if you think I took something for granted, or something is not well explained shoot me a message at gaiagaudenzi9@gmail.com

# <a name="stata_basics">Stata Basics</a>

## What is Stata? 
Nothing else than a statistic software to analyze your data! It is widely used (at least in Economics) and it is very simple to use. You can browse through this training to have a sense of what you can do with it and get used to the language and terminology. Luckily enough, Stata has excellent official resources to learn it and great online support. If you have a question on how to do something, you can look for an answer (if it's there already) or ask your question on the forum <span style="font-size:20px">[Statalist](https://www.statalist.org/)</span>.

<!--!### Stata interface
Here is an example of the Stata interface:

[Stata_interface]({{site.url}}/images/Stata1.png)


* <span style="color:blue;font-size:17px">History window</span>: Commands you write directly on the command prompt get stored there, so that if you want to re-run them, you just click on them and they appear on the command prompt without the need for you to type them again.
* <span style="color:fuchsia;font-size:17px">Results window</span>: Where the output from your commands, error messages and all the other programme operations get printed. You can scroll it to see what is the output of the code you wrote (regression output etc.)
* <span style="color:green;font-size:17px">Command prompt</span>: Where you can type your command (not recommended)
* <span style="color:red;font-size:17px">Variables window</span>: Where you can see all the variables and labels of the dataset that is loaded
* <span style="color:orange;font-size:17px">Properties window</span>: Where you can see all the properties of the variables of the dataset that is loaded

You should use the interface only to look at variables, at the output etc. you should NOT type from the command prompt, except for quick checks. It is extremely inefficient to type your commands directly into the Command prompt. You should use *dofiles* instead! (We'll talk about them in a second).

### Data editor window
In each Stata dataset, each column corresponds to one variable and each row corresponds to one observation. It is up to you to understand whether each row corresponds to a distinct observation depending on your unit of observation. We will see afterwards the Stata commands that allow you to understand whether a variable (or a combination of variables) is an id for a specific dataset.

The different colors of the variables in the data editor window gives us information on the format of the variable (whether it is string, numerical or a labeled variable).
 -->
### Commands 

Stata works with commands. Every line of code you type on Stata corresponds to a command. So with every line, you are asking Stata to perform a different action. This is an example of two lines of command in Stata:

```stata
1. use "/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Stata/dataset.dta"
2. browse
```
"translated" in plain English, these two lines of code correspond to:

<!--<span style="font-size:20px"></span><br>-->
* Open the dataset named "dataset.dta" that is on my laptop, specifically in the directory "/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Stata/"
* Browse through the variables that are inside this dataset

There are of course many many commands, depending on the operations you want to perform and on which variable. If you are not sure about which command you want to use, or how a command is supposed to be used, Stata will always help you. You just have to type

```stata
help
```
followed by the name of the command (Fun fact: help is iteslf a command, that helps you understand other commands). Stata will open the documentation and show you some examples on how to use that command. Througout this training, I will make extensive use of the data documentation, so that you can get familiar with it and become more and more independent.

## <a name="structure_of_commands">Structure of a command</a>

To let you know how the help command works, and what is the basic structure of a command as you see it on the Stata documentation, I take the code <code>summarize</code> as an example. It is a code that calculates for you the number of observations, the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum and the maximum of a variable. By typing <code>help summarize</code> we get the syntax of this code:

```stata
summarize [varlist] [if] [in] [weight] [, options]
```


Let’s start talking about how you can actually load datasets on Stata. The extension stata uses for its file is .dta, so the name of a dataset in Stata format will look like this: dataset.dta. However, you can import a wide variety of files with different formats into Stata (Excel, csv etc.)

## <a name="directories">Directories</a>

How can you locate on your laptop the files you will load into Stata? With the directory of the file itself! For every file you import/load in Stata you have to specify the directory, to tell Stata where exactly it has to find the file. So, to load a *.dta* file into Stata, you will use the following syntax:

```stata
use "yourdirectory/dataset.dta"
```

Where "yourdirectory" is the directory where the file is. For example, in the box below, I show the directory of the file example.dta contained on my computer in the directory "/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Stata"

```stata
use "/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Stata/dataset.dta"
```

This will open the file dataset.dta on Stata.

To know in which directory you are at the moment, type on the Command prompt:

```stata
pwd
```

It will return the directory Stata is in. In my case now it is:
```stata
"/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Stata/dataset.dta"
```

To change directory (in this example I change from “/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Stata” to “/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Datasets”)

```stata
cd “/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Datasets”
```

To create directories (this will create folders into your laptop! In this example I create the folder “NewDirectory”)

```stata
mkdir “/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/NewDirectory”
```

## <a name="importing">Importing data from Stata and from external sources (.xlsx, .csv, etc.)</a>

We have already seen that to load a dataset into Stata that is already in .dta format, the command is `use` followed by the directory and the name of the file. What if we want to import an Excel file?

```stata
import excel using “yourdirectory/SampleExcelFile.xlsx”, clear
```
> N.B. Stata only allows to open one variable at a time. This means that you will always have to specify the option `clear` after the comma as in the example above. Otherwise Stata will give you an error of this type:

`no; data in memory will be lost`

# <a name="setup">Setup</a>

## How to organize your workflow

### Use dofiles! 
When using Stata for research, one of your first concerns should be how to make sure your work is transparent and reproducible, and how to make sure that, if you look at a clean dataset 5 years after, you are able to trace back any modification you make to the raw data and (ideally) also know why you made that modification. Dofiles help doing all of this! Why are they called Dofiles? because their extension is  .do. Dofiles allow you to quickly reproduce your work and leave comments between your lines of code, so that you can note down what you are doing, and why you are doing it. Ideally a Dofile should be written in a way that allows another Stata user (or your future self, which 99% of the time will NOT remember why you did what you did) to understand everything you did in there without effort. 

Guidelines to write dofiles
* **Always** put clear comment on anything you are doing. The comments should be concise and explain _what_ are you doing and _why_ you are doing it.
* **Always** put a preamble at the beginning of the dofile explaining what you are accomplishing with that specific dofile.
* Do not put everything inside the same dofile! Try to create one dofile for each task (es. one dofile that cleans the data and another one that analyzes them)
* Automate everything that can be **easily automated**. (e.g. if you are performing repetitive actions in a dofile you may want to consider using loops to make your code more efficient. 
* **Avoid hard coding** at all costs: DO NOT embed in your code something that cannot be changed directly/is specific to that dataset. Try to use macros and e() or r() results to avoid typing dofiles that will depend on a specific numbers you would always be boudn to check. For more info see: Create a setting for collaborative coding. 
* Delete anything that is not essential: I know it feels bad to delete chunks of code you have been working on for hours. However, if you leave them in the middle of your document, they will clutter the space and you are going to start hating them as well. If you are too attached to your old code to delete it, put it at the end of the dofile and use the command `exit` so that the dofile stops before reading it. Example 


```code
*- END DOFILE --------------------
exit

/*
Old code for task X

put your old code here
```


### Create a folder structure 
You should create a folder structure on your laptop where you store all the document and data of the project so that you immediately know where they are. This is important so that you don't waste time in the future looking for "that dataset I created a wile ago".
The minimum structure I suggest is presented below:
* **Data** _here you store all the data you need for your analysis_
  * **Raw** _here you store all the raw data (not processed, saved as they come in from the server)_
  * **Processed** _here you store all the data you manipulated (partial datasets etc.)_
  * **Final** _here you store all the FINAL data (this should be the final version of the data ready for publication)_
* **Codes and documentation** _here you store all your dofiles, R script, documentation of the datasets etc._
* **Output** _here you store all your dofiles, R script etc._
  * **Tables** _here you store all the tables that come out as an output from your codes_
  * **Graphs** _here you store all the graphs that come out as an output from your codes_

*N.B. You may want to check iefolder, a user-written command the World Bank created to automatically create a folder structure from Stata.*

### Create a workflow

### Create a setting for collaborative coding: Main.do

Being organized is important if you are working on a project on your own. It is much more important so when you are working with other people. Your team most likely will store the project files (Data, codes etc.) on a cloud system (Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive etc.). Every member of the team should be able to run the scripts from their personal laptop, this means:
1. Every person working on the project would need to have the same Stata settings.
2. Any eventual command present in other dofiles that is not installed in Stata by default should be installed by everybody. 
3. Every person should be able to access the data and output folder to reproduce the results.

This information should be ideally contained in a Main.do dofile, that defines the common settings, installs extra command if needed, and provides users direct access to files. 
1,2 are easier to achieve, but what about 3? There is a very simple way also to achieve this in Stata, to see it let's take a step back and explore what are macros in Stata. 

### Macros (globals and locals)

A common definition for macros is the following[^1]
> Macros are abbreviations for a string of characters or a number. 

It might not seem so at the moment, but macros are very powerful tools we will use throughout this course. The two macros we will describe now are `local` and `global`. 

First of all, let's see which description Stata offers for them:

>global assigns strings to specified global macro names (mnames). local assigns strings to local macro names (lclnames). Both double quotes (" and ") and compound double quotes (‘" and "’) are allowed

This might look very obscure to you, but I promise it will be clear in a moment. 

At this stage I would like to think about macros an empty box, where you can store content. You can store pretty much anything you want in that box, either numbers or letters.

`local` are macros that are valid only as long as you execute commands in do-files.  
`globals` are macros that are valid for the entire duration of the Stata session (so they are valid until you cancel them or you close Stata). A Stata session lasts from the moment you open Stata to the moment you close it. Meaning if you load another dataset without having closed Stata previously, you are in the same Stata session.

Let's look at the syntax for local

`local localname "string"`   _This allows you to store strings_  
`local localname = expression` _This allows you to store numbers_

#### Example 1: Create your first local
I want to create a local that stores my name, so that when I "call" it or execute it, it will return my name:

``` code
local my_name "Gaia Gaudenzi"
display "`my_name'"
```
Try to copy this code in a dofile, replace it with your name and run the code. What happens? What happens if you run the lines separately?

#### Example 2: Create your first global
Similarly as we did before, I will create a global that stores my cat name (Minou), so that when I "call" it or execute it, it will return my cat's name:

``` code
global my_cat_name "Minou"
display "$my_cat_name"
```

>Note that I "called" globals and locals in a different way. To show what's inside a local, you have to put `' around the name of the local, while to "call" a global you have to put a $ at the beginning of the name of the global.

Try to copy this code in a dofile, replace it with your name and run the code. What happens? What happens if you run the lines separately?

>Tips for code: When you are not sure whether you specified a global correctly, just run ```display "$nameofglobal"``` and inspect what is the actual output Stata gives back for that specific global.


**Ok. great. But how is this useful?** Since globals store strings, we can use them to store directories so that we don't have to type always the entire directory of a file when we import/export it. This reduces errors and forces you to organize files in "bins" that can be accessed through pre defined globals.

#### Application 1: Create your first global that stores directory

>Tip for code: never use backslashes in your code, these cannot be read by MacOS or Linux laptop

Let's say I have a Data folder where I store all my data, and I want to import an Excel (called SampleExcel.xlsx) from that folder. The directory of that folder on my laptop is  
"/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Stata/Data"
> Note that this directory is specific to my laptop, i.e. it specifically indicates the location of the Data folder on my laptop.

If I want to import SampleExcel.xlsx into Stata, I would have to write:

``` code
import excel using "/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Stata/Data/SampleExcel.xlsx"
```
However, this is inconvenient for two reasons:
* It is unnecessarily cumbersome: Everytime I would want to refer to this file in the code to import/export it, I would have to attach to SampleExcel.xlsx the whole directory, or run an additional line telling Stata to pick the file from that specific directory like in the example below:

```
cd "/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Stata/Data/"
use "SampleExcel.xlsx"
```
* This "ties" Stata to a directory on my specific laptop. This is not great for collaborative coding since another user that have access to the same file cannot run the dofile automatically.

The solution to this involves the use of macros. We can construct a dofile that stores our specific directories into a macro so that Stata dynamically changes the directory based on the user. (I also recommend doing that even if you are working on a project on your own, because it forces you to follow a structure to catalogue your files so that you never have doubts on where things are).

>Pause for thought: Which one of the macro we have seen so far would be adequate for this specific task? global or local? Why?

We can construct a program that tells Stata "If the username of this laptop is X, then the directory from which you have to take the file is Y". In my case this sentence translates into "If the username of this laptop is gaiagaudenzi, then the directory from which you have to take the file is "/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Stata/Data/" "

Constructing this program involves 2 steps:

```
display "`c(username)'"
```
2. Create specific globals that contains the chunk of directory you need to get to your files.

Here below an example of a dofile that creates specific globals for each user so that it allows different people working from different laptops to collaborate on the same file.

```code
* Run this to find your username 
display "`c(username)'"

if "`c(username)'"== "gaiagaudenzi" { // Gaia
		global directory_root   "/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Stata/Data/"
```
If you want to add more users, you just add another condition on the if

```code
* Run this to find your username 
display "`c(username)'"

if "`c(username)'"== "gaiagaudenzi" { // Gaia
		global directory_root   "/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Stata/Data/"
		
if "`c(username)'"== "otheruser" { // Other user
		global directory_root   "/Users/otheruser/Documents/Stata/Data/"
```

Now, try to run 
```code
display "$directory_root"
```
> Pause for thought: If the setting of the global is correct, what should be the output of this line of code?

From this point you can:
1. map your folder structure into this dofile to create globals that access all the folders
2. directly create the folder structure from here 


Code for option 1:

Before creating this dofile, I manually create the folder into my project folder, and then I construct the globals to accesss to it.
```code
* Run this to find your username 
display "`c(username)'"

* Create the global root
if "`c(username)'"== "gaiagaudenzi" { // Gaia
		global directory_root   "/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Stata/"
		
if "`c(username)'"== "otheruser" { // Other user
		global directory_root   "/Users/otheruser/Documents/Stata/"

* Define globals to access all folders in the project (use directory_root)		
    global data "$directory_root/Data"
    global output "$directory_root/Output"

        * Specific output globals
        global tables "$directory_root/Output/Tables"
        global graphs "$directory_root/Output/Graphs"
```
> Pause for thought: What did I do here? I used the previously created global ($directory_root) to create another global. Why is this important? How do I make sure globals work?

Option 1: Comment the mkdir section (recommended)

```code
/*
mkdir "$directory_root/Data"
mkdir "$directory_root/Output"
   * Specific output globals
mkdir "$directory_root/Output/Tables"
mkdir "$directory_root/Output/Graphs"
*/
```

Option 2: use `capture`. You can use it in front of every command. It tells Stata to basically ignore the error and continue running the dofile if it encounters an error on that specific line. It is not advisable in general to use capture because if there is an error, then it means that something with your data is wrong. In this case we know the source of error, so we actually don't care that Stata keeps running even in the presence of one error. In other cases, it might be relevant to know why Stata stopped working and what kind of error it ecountered. 

```code
capture mkdir "$directory_root/Data"
capture mkdir "$directory_root/Output"
   * Specific output globals
capture mkdir "$directory_root/Output/Tables"
capture mkdir "$directory_root/Output/Graphs"
```
The World Bank has created `iefolder`, a very nice command to create standardized folder structures, you may want to check it out!

So now we can have a look at how a Main.do should look like. As we said previously it should:
1. Set the basic Stata settings.
2. Install any extra commands. 
3. Provide dynamic user-specific paths.

```
* 1. Set Stata settings

	clear all
	clear matrix
	clear mata
	clear results
	set more off
	set maxvar 20000
	capture log close

* 2. Install extra commands

	ssc install tabmiss
	ssc install dropmiss

* 3. User-specific paths

	* If you forgot your username run:
	display "`c(username)'"

	if "`c(username)'"== "gaiagaudenzi" { // Gaia
			global directory_root   "/Users/gaiagaudenzi/Documents/Stata/"
			
	if "`c(username)'"== "otheruser" { // Other user
			global directory_root   "/Users/otheruser/Documents/Stata/"

	* Define globals to access all folders in the project		

		global data "$directory_root/Data"
		global output "$directory_root/Output"
			* Specific output globals
			global tables "$directory_root/Output/Tables"
			global graphs "$directory_root/Output/Graphs"
```

# <a name="cleaning">Data cleaning</a>
## Explore your data

#### ```codebook```
#### ```summarize```
#### ```tab ```
#### ```describe ```
#### ```isid ```
#### ```assert ```
#### ```inspect ```
#### ```compare ```
#### ```list ```
#### ```destring/tostring```

As we saw before, Stata has different formats for variables (mainly numeric, string and labeled). If you are trying to perform a command on a numeric variable that has been imported as string, you get an error. Luckily, you can convert a string variable into a numeric one using  `destring `. 

To convert a numeric variable into string you can use `destring `:


 ```code
	* To convert a string variable into a numeric variable
    destring(var), replace
	* To convert a numeric variable into a string variable
    tostring(var), replace 
	* To convert ALL variables in the dataset into numeric
	destring(*), replace
```

> N.B. If a variable contains string characters other than plain numbers, Stata will NOT convert the variable into a numeric one. Check the output of your destring/tostring to understand if Stata performed it correctly.

> N.B. In general, I prefer to import all variables as string, so that I can inspect them as they are (check the date format etc.) and then destring what I need. 

### Identify missing values 
There might be different types of missing values. If you are running a survey, then a value might be missing for a specific question because the person didn't know the answer, because he/she refused to answer or other reasons. It is important to distinguish between these different types of missing values so that you can make further considerations on your study design or implementation (i.e. was the question too hard? Is the question posed in a way that might make respondents feel threatened? etc.)

The code to identify/categorize missing values on Stata is `mvdecode`. 

Let's say you ran a survey, and for question 1 (we will refer to it as Q1) you have these values:

Q1 Do you like school?
1= Not at all
2= A little
3= I like it
4= I love it
-96= I don't know
-99= I don't want to answer

How do you categorize the values that have been recorded as missing (namely -96 and -99) ?

```
* Decode missing values (Use .d for "Don't know'" and .r for "Refuses to answer")
mvdecode Q1, mv(-99=.d \ -96=.r)
```

This will change the numeric values from numeric to missing values (and will preserve the reason why they are missing values)

**Note: Stata categorized missing values as "infinity". You should keep this in mind every time you type specific codes for which the result might change e.g. `gen var_new if var > 10000` This will also include missing values.**

### Dealing with duplicates 

Another challenge when working with data will be to identify potential duplicates. To do that you have first to identify what is the unique identifier of your dataset (or your id). By looking at the data you should be able to identify it. To check whether a variable (or a combination of them) is an id, type:

```
isid id_name
```

This will tell you if a variable is a unique identifier of the observations. If not, you should look at how many duplicates does the data have. To flag duplicates, run:
```
* Flag duplicates
duplicates tag id_name, gen(tag)
* Tab the result of flagging duplicates
tab tag
```

Then you'll have to inspect manually the duplicates to see if they really are duplicates or if there is another mistake in the data.

## Renaming variables
The syntax for renaming variables is really simple, you just have to run:
```
rename oldvar newvar
```

But what about renaming a group of variables? Let's say I want to rename a set of variables with the same prefix because I want to signal that these variables come from the same dataset D1 :
```code
renvars _all, prefix(D1_)
```
`renvars` might come handy also when you want to reshape a dataset from wide to long format. See the reshape section for more details.

## Labeling variables
It is important to have a clean dataset with all the variables (and the values inside them) correctly labeled. This will avid confusion when you are running your analysis.
To label variables:
```
label var varname "Variable Label"
```
To label values inside a variable:
```
* First step: define the value labels
label define yesno 1 "Yes" 0 "No"
* Second step: Attach value labels to values
label values var yesno
```

Renaming and labeling values might be a boring and repetitive job. Especially when there is no automated way to do that and you have to rename everything from scratch. [Here]() there is a tool that might come handy if you have to rename an entire dataset in a non-uniform way (i.e. you _actually_ need to change the name of the variables, not just adding prefixes/suffixes). This file is an Excel file that automates a little bit the process of renaming by using the concatenate function in Excel. It then produces a code you can easily copy and paste into Stata for renaming/labeling a buch of variables.
## A note on generating variables: 
### egen vs gen
What is the difference between egen and gen?

In theory, there is no significant difference, they both generate new variables. However, they work with different functions.

The story on why egen and gen exist is not entirely clear to some people, more information [here](https://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/1538833-egen-vs-gen-origin-story)

Let's look at the Stata documentation helpfile:

```
generate [type] newvar[:lblname] =exp [if] [in] [, before(varname) |
                 after(varname)]
```

```
egen [type] newvar = fcn(arguments) [if] [in] [, options]
```
In practice, we care about this distinction only to know whether with a specific function we should use egen or gen. For example the functions `mean()`, `sum()`, `total()`, `rowtotal()` work only with egen.

**WARNING**: Sometimes a variable can be generated both by `egen` and `gen`, but it can give very different outputs. For example, summing variables in `gen` will preserve missing values, while summing a variable using `rowtotal()` in `egen` will turn missing values into 0. Depending on where you want to use this new variable for, you should be extra careful about how your missing data are handled.

### bysort + _n vs _N

What are _n and _N? They are built-in variables in Stata.
* _n gives you the number of the specific observation you are looking at (whether it is the first, the second etc.)
* _N gives you the total count of the observations in the datasets (i.e. _N=500 if you have 500 observations in the dataset)
To make sure you understand what they do, create these 2 new variables:

```code
gen obsnum = _n
gen totnum = _N
```
Nice to know, but not very useful so far. However, they become pretty powerful when used in combination with `by` or `bysort()`. For example, if you have panel data, and you want to know how many observations are in the dataset for a single person:

```code
bys id year: g num_obs_per_person=_n
```

### calling results from r() and e()
Sometimes you want to create a variable based on the summary statistics of another variable. For example, you may want to create a dummy = 1 if the total score of something is below the average. Normally, you would summarize the variable that contains the total score, then you will pick from there the average value to generate your dummy. You should NOT HARD CODE THE VALUE OF THE AVERAGE, i.e. looking at the value of the average and hard code it into the dofile. There is a better and more automated way to achieve that! 

Some commands store results in their memories. For example, if you run `summarize` and then `return list` you will see something like this:  

```code
XXX
```
This ensures that Stata will always have the correct number of the average, even if we change the input dataset to load a more updated one.

```code
gen below_average=totalscore<`r(mean)'
```
## Cleaning strings

Sometimes you may want to insert something in your analysis that is contained in the string variable, but in order to use them you have to ensure they are clean. Stata is case sensitive so the string "Stata" is different to the string "stata". Luckily, there is a farly easy way to homogenize variables. How to use them? They are not properly commands, but functions, so you cannot type directly the function on Stata, you would need an "auxiliary" command. Examples below:

#### ```trim``` Removes all the excess spaces _outside_ a string variable
#### ```itrim``` Removes all the excess spaces _inside_ a string variable

#### ```proper``` converts all the first letters of a string in uppercase. (e.s. gaia gaudenzi becomes Gaia Gaudenzi). Might be useful as a starting point to clean names. 
#### ```lower``` converts the entire characters of the strings in lowercase.
#### ```upper``` converts the entire characters of the strings in uppercase.

```
* Remove excess spaces outside variable
replace var=trim(var)
* Remove excess spaces inside variable
replace var=itrim(var)
    * You can also combine them to remove excess spaces outside or inside
    replace var=trim(itrim(var))
* Capitalize Each Letter
replace var=proper(var)
* all lowercase
replace var=lower(var)
* ALL UPPERCASE
replace var=upper(var)
```

>Little dictionary on Stata Regular expressions useful to handle string variables
>
> **Counting**     
> `*`	Asterisk means “match zero or more” of the preceding expression.   
> `+`	Plus sign means “match one or more” of the preceding expression.  
> `?`	Question mark means “match either zero or one” of the preceding expression.
>	
> **Characters**
> `a–z`	The dash operator means “match a range of characters or numbers”. The “a” and “z” are merely an example. It could also be 0–9, 5–8, F–M, etc.     
> `.`	Period means “match any character”.  
> `/`	A backslash is used as an escape character to match characters that would otherwise be interpreted as a regular-expression operator.
> 	
> **Anchors**  
> `^`	When placed at the beginning of a regular expression, the caret means “match expression at beginning of string”. This character can be thought of as an “anchor” character since it does not directly match a character, only the location of the match.  
> `$`	When the dollar sign is placed at the end of a regular expression, it means “match expression at end of string”. This is the other anchor character.
> **Groups**
> `|`	The pipe character signifies a logical “or” that is often used in character sets (see square brackets below).  
> `[ ]`	Square brackets denote a set of allowable characters/expressions to use in matching, such as [a-zA-Z0-9] for all alphanumeric characters.  
> `( )`	Parentheses must match and denote a subexpression group.

	
### Extended functions

* Use a local that displays a progressive number
	
	local i=1
	
	forvalues x=0/5 { // or firstvalue(intervalnumber)lastvalue
	
	display `x'
	display `i'
	
	local ++i
	
	}

## Reshape

You can reshape in long or wide form. To perform the majority of analyses
	with STATA you will need 99.9% of the time a reshape long, while usually a reshape wide is useful to make more readable the tables you export. You can reshape according to a string or numerical variable. The syntax is the following: 
	
Where stub can be
 1. a single variable: stub
 2. All variables that start with the same prefix: stub*
 3. An interval of variables: stubfirstvar-stublastvar
	
	i(i) is your ID variable
	j(j)  is the variable whose unique values denote a subobservation (usually is the year)
## Randomization

When you are drawing a random subset of a sample, to make it reproducible, you have to make sure you **set the seed** first, before you actually draw the sample to do that type:
```code 
set seed 87
```
To sample 10% of the sample
```code 
sample 10
```

To sample 200 observations in the sample
```code
sample 200, count
```
## Automation: Loops

	sysuse auto 
	
	* To loop over a set of strings
	
	foreach x in trunk weight length {
	
	display "`x'"
	
	}
	
	* To loop over a set of numbers
	
	forvalues x=1/5 { // or firstvalue(intervalnumber)lastvalue
	
	display `x'
	
	}
	
	* To loop over a set of variables
	
	foreach var of varlist price-gear_ratio { // or firstvalue(intervalnumber)lastvalue
	
	display "`var'"
	
	}
	
	* To loop over a set of values of a variable
	
	levelsof make, local(maker)
	foreach m in `maker' {
	
	di "`m'"
	
	}

![graph_errorbar]({{site.url}}/images/graph_errorbar.png)

Creating a graph with error bar in Stata involves some transformation of the dataset. If you are not familiar with collapse or reshape, please visit the corresponding section. Here we would like to create a graph with the corresponding error bars. Let’s use the built-in dataset ``city temp.dta```
to show how to build a graph with error bar. 
```stata
* Load data
sysuse citytemp.dta
```
We see that the dataset records different temperatures in two times of the year: January and July. We would like to create a bar graph that shows the average temperatures in the 2 months by region, but also showing confidence intervals.
We start forming our dataset to create the graph:
```stata
collapse (mean) mean_tempjan=tempjan mean_tempjul=tempjul ///
	 (sd) sd_tempjan=tempjan sd_tempjul=tempjul ///
	 (count) n_tempjan=tempjan n_tempjul=tempjul, by(region)

reshape long mean_temp sd_temp n_temp, i(region) j(month) str
```
Then, we calculate upper and lower values of confidence intervals
```
generate hi_temp = mean_temp + invttail(n-1,0.025)*(sd_temp / sqrt(n_temp))
generate lower_temp = mean_temp - invttail(n-1,0.025)*(sd_temp / sqrt(n_temp))

```
Now we generate a “fake” x-axis, which will allow us to plot the bars exactly in the order we want
```
generate xaxis = 1 if region == 1 & month == "jan"
replace  xaxis = 2 if region == 1 & month == "jul"
replace  xaxis = 3 if region == 2 & month == "jan"
replace  xaxis = 4 if region == 2 & month == "jul"
replace  xaxis = 5 if region == 3 & month == "jan"
replace  xaxis = 6 if region == 3 & month == "jul"
replace  xaxis = 7 if region == 4 & month == "jan"
replace  xaxis = 8 if region == 4 & month == "jul"
```
And we are ready to generate the graph:
```
twoway (bar mean_temp xaxis if region == 1) ///
       (bar mean_temp xaxis if region == 2) ///
       (bar mean_temp xaxis if region == 3) ///
       (bar mean_temp xaxis if region == 4) ///
       (rcap hi_temp lowr_temp xaxis, color(black)), ///
       legend(row(1) order(1 "NE" 2 "N Cntrl" 3 "South" 4 "West") ) ///
       xlabel( 1 "Jan" 2 "Jul" 3 "Jan" 4 "Jul" 5 "Jan" 6 "Jul" 7 "Jan" 8 "Jul") ///
	   graphregion(color(white)) ///
       xtitle("Months") ytitle("Mean temperature")

```

## <a name="maps">Maps</a>
Did you know you can create simple maps in Stata? This is thanks to the absolutely awesome people that invented the spmap command. Here below the code to create this simple map of Bangladesh. I created this map when I was in Bangladesh right before a data collection, to visually see in which districts it was impossible to go during the monsoon season in that specific year. 

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/Bangladesh_map.png" alt="Bangladesh map" class="center" style="height: 699px; width:553px;"/>

The first thing you need to do, is to download a shapefile with the administrative division that interests you (just google Country X shapefile and download). You will need to have a file with the extension .shp, which you can convert in .dta and exploit for graphs. Let's see all the steps below:

```code

* 1 STEP: Convert shapefile to .dta

	shp2dta using ///
	
	"$maps/gadm36_BGD_2.shp", ///  
	data("$maps/BGD_zilamap") ///
	coor("$maps/BGD_zilacoor") ///   
	replace genid(id)
	
	u "$maps/BGD_zilamap.dta", clear
	
	spmap using "$maps/BGD_zilacoor.dta", id(id) 

* Mark unfeasible districts

	u "$maps/BGD_zilamap.dta", clear

	* 1.1 Mark Hill tract areas
	#delim ;
	g var = "Hill tract/Cox's"
	if NAME_2 == "Chittagong" 
	| NAME_2 == "Khagrachhari" 
	| NAME_2 == "Rangamati"
	| NAME_2 == "Bandarban" 
	| NAME_2 == "Cox'S Bazar"
	;
	#delim cr

	* 1.2 Mark Haor areas
	#delim ;
	replace var = "Haor areas" 
	if NAME_2 == "Sylhet" 
	| NAME_2 == "Maulvibazar"
	| NAME_2 == "Habiganj"
	| NAME_2 == "Sunamganj"
	;
	#delim cr

	* 1.3 Mark areas affected by Cyclones
	#delim ;
	replace var = "Cyclones" 
	if NAME_2 == "Khulna"
	| NAME_2 == "Bagerhat" 
	| NAME_2 == "Pirojpur" 
	| NAME_2 == "Jhalokati"
	| NAME_2 == "Patuakhali"
	| NAME_2 == "Barguna"
	| NAME_2 == "Bhola"
	| NAME_2 == "Noakhali" 
	| NAME_2 == "Satkhira"  
	;
	#delim cr

	* 1.4 Mark areas affected by flooding
	#delim ;
	replace var = "Flooding" 
	if NAME_2 == "Faridpur" 
	| NAME_2 == "Sirajganj" 
	| NAME_2 == "Tangail"
	| NAME_2 == "Jamalpur" 
	| NAME_2 == "Gaibandha" 
	| NAME_2 == "Lakshmipur" 
	;
	#delim cr

	* 1.5 Mark areas affected by water logging
	replace var = "Water Logging" if NAME_2 == "Jessore" 

	* 1.6 Mark areas affected by flash flood (if not already eliminated)
	replace var = "Flash flood" if NAME_2 == "Netrakona" 

	encode var, g(var2)
	
	preserve
		* Create labels (not compulsory)
		u "$training_data/4_Data visualization/Map/BGD_zilacoor.dta", clear
		collapse (mean) _X _Y, by(_ID)
		rename _ID id
		merge 1:1 id using "$maps/BGD_zilamap.dta"
		keep id _X _Y NAME_2
		save "$training_data/4_Data visualization/Map/BGD_label_coor", replace
	restore
	
	* 1.7 Create map
	spmap var2 using "$maps/BGD_zilacoor.dta" , ///
	id(id) clmethod(unique)  ocolor(gs8 ..) fcolor(Pastel2) ndocolor(gs8 ..) ///
	name(base, replace) ndlab("Available districts") ///
	title({bf:Logistically unfeasible districts}) ///
	label(data("$maps/BGD_label_coor.dta") ///
	label(NAME_2) xcoord(_X) ycoord(_Y) length(20) size(*0.5) gap(*1) color(black)) legend(pos(7))

graph export "$training_output/Bangladesh_map.png", as(png) replace
```
