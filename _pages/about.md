Hello there! My name is Gaia Gaudenzi and I am currently a PhD student at the University of Maryland.
I was a Predoctoral Research Assistant at the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago. Before, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Laboratory for Effective Anti-Poverty Policies at Bocconi University and at BRAC Bangladesh. I am interested in development economics and behavioral economics.
